Dear XBian Forker,

Last week we did some big changes on our main xbian repository. We are pleased to see that you have forked us but want to ask if you can delete your fork and re-fork us, so we are in sync again?

Thanks in advanced!

Regards, CurlyMoo

ps I. If you have any questions, you can contact me on development@xbian.org or the xbian.org forum.<br />
ps II. This not only counts for our main 'xbian' repo, but for all repo's you might have forked from us.
